## ✅ How to Test the Fixed Scrolling

The browser is now open at **http://localhost:3000**. Follow these tests to verify the natural scrolling experience:

---

## 🖱️ Test 1: Trackpad Scrolling (Primary Test)

### Steps:
1. Place two fingers on your trackpad
2. Swipe up/down naturally (as you would on any website)
3. Try different speeds: slow, medium, fast
4. Try scrolling backward (up) while scrolling down

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- **Instant response** - page scrolls immediately when you move fingers
- **Natural momentum** - continues scrolling smoothly when you lift fingers
- **Follows your gesture** - speed matches your swipe speed
- **No delay** - no lag between gesture and scroll
- **Smooth deceleration** - natural slow-down at end of momentum

### ❌ What Should NOT Happen:
- No stuttering or janking
- No delay or lag
- No feeling of "fighting" the scroll
- No unexpected smooth/slow animation during regular scrolling

---

## 🖱️ Test 2: Mouse Wheel Scrolling

### Steps:
1. Use mouse scroll wheel to scroll down
2. Scroll up
3. Try quick scroll motions
4. Try slow, deliberate scrolls

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- **Immediate scrolling** - each wheel click/roll scrolls instantly
- **Consistent distance** - each roll moves the same amount
- **No smoothing** - natural, instant response
- **Precise control** - you control exactly how much to scroll

---

## 🖱️ Test 3: Navigation Link Clicking

### Steps:
1. Click "Features" in the navigation bar
2. Click "Destinations"
3. Click "Book Your Adventure" button in hero
4. Try all navigation links

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- **Smooth animated scroll** - scrolls smoothly to the section
- **Intentional feeling** - feels like a deliberate navigation
- **Stops at section** - lands exactly at the target section
- **Not too slow** - animation completes in ~600ms

### This is DIFFERENT from regular scrolling:
- Regular scroll = instant natural
- Navigation click = smooth animated

---

## 📱 Test 4: Mobile Touch Scrolling (If Available)

### Steps:
1. Open on mobile device or use DevTools mobile emulation
2. Swipe up/down with finger
3. Try fast flick gestures
4. Try slow drag scrolls

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- **iOS momentum** - beautiful inertia scrolling
- **Smooth on all devices** - no janking
- **Responsive** - follows finger exactly
- **Proper bounce** - iOS rubber band effect (on iOS)

---

## 🎯 Test 5: All Sections Render Immediately

### Steps:
1. Open homepage
2. Check if all sections are visible (not loading skeletons)
3. Scroll down immediately - content should already be there

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- Hero section: ✅ Visible immediately
- Features section: ✅ Visible immediately (no skeleton)
- Destinations section: ✅ Visible immediately
- Testimonials section: ✅ Visible immediately
- Booking section: ✅ Visible immediately

**No loading states!** Everything renders at once.
