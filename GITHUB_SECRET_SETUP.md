# 🔐 GitHub Secret Setup Guide

## ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**

Your GitHub Actions workflow needs the Google Analytics ID to build successfully.

---

## 📋 **Quick Setup (2 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Open GitHub Secrets Page**

Click this link (it will open directly to the right page):

👉 **https://github.com/Oksana3301/tourismwebsite/settings/secrets/actions**

### **Step 2: Add New Secret**

1. Click the green **"New repository secret"** button (top right)
2. You'll see a form with two fields:
   - **Name**: Type exactly: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`
   - **Secret**: Type exactly: `G-X8MYV8LJ2N`
3. Click the green **"Add secret"** button at the bottom

That's it! ✅

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

### **Option 1: Check Latest Deploy (Just Triggered)**

I just pushed a commit, which triggered a new deployment:

1. Go to: **https://github.com/Oksana3301/tourismwebsite/actions**
2. Look for the yellow circle 🟡 next to "📝 Add deployment fix documentation"
3. After adding the secret above, it should turn to:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = SUCCESS!
   - ❌ Red X = Still need to add the secret

### **Option 2: Manual Test**

Make a small change and push:

```bash
cd /Users/atikadewisuryani/Desktop/wisatapadang/wisatapadang
echo "Test deployment: $(date)" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "Test auto-deploy"
git push origin main
```

Then check: https://github.com/Oksana3301/tourismwebsite/actions

## 🔍 **What the Secret Does**

The secret `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` is used to:
- Track website visitors with Google Analytics
- Include analytics code in the production build
- **Without it**: Build fails because the analytics component expects it

---

## ✅ **Expected Timeline**

| Time | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Now** | Add secret to GitHub |
| **1-2 min** | GitHub Actions picks up the secret |
| **3-5 min** | Build completes successfully ✅ |
| **5-7 min** | New version live on https://sumateraway.web.app 🎉 |

## 📞 **Troubleshooting**

### Still seeing red X after adding secret?

1. **Check the secret name**: Must be exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` (case-sensitive)
2. **Check the secret value**: Must be exactly `G-X8MYV8LJ2N`
3. **Re-run the workflow**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Oksana3301/tourismwebsite/actions
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Click **"Re-run all jobs"** (top right)

### How to verify secret is set?

1. Go to: https://github.com/Oksana3301/tourismwebsite/settings/secrets/actions
2. You should see `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` in the list
3. **Note**: You can't see the value after saving (for security), but you'll see the name

---

## 🎯 **After Secret is Added**

Every time you push to `main` branch:

1. ✅ GitHub Actions automatically builds your site
2. ✅ Deploys to Firebase Hosting
3. ✅ Live at https://sumateraway.web.app in 3-5 minutes
4. ✅ Google Analytics starts tracking

**No more manual deployments needed!** 🚀
